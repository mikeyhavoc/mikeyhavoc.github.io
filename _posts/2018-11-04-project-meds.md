# Little Blue..The Beginning

_Project Little Blue_ is part of my goal to do not exactly 6 start ups in 6 - 8 months. But 6 apps, projects in 6 months. Project Little Blue is the first one, a personal medication app. I want to take an Idea, and form it into an project, then into an application that has some sort of purpose. 

Not only do I want to do this, but I want to build 6 projects, of different varying usage, reasons for being around, and accomplish different goals. This is is my test I believe I need for myself. To see, if I belong in the software/tech industry. Not only that but to truly test everything under my tool belt, how to adapt, how to truly grow, and how to rapidly grow like I truly believe I can and should. 

## The project

The Medication app, is an application you:

- [x] add your patient(s)
- [x] add your dr.(s)
- [x] add your medication(s) (still in beta --not saving to database-- on what is needed for best results).
- [x] can view list of patients in the DB(would be switched to a single patient per save space in an online mode.).
- [x] view dr. list for patients (only would be for one single patient in an online save space).

Future goals: 
- [ ] check off medication taken page . (working on layout for top UX/UI designs to make it comfortable to use.)
- [ ] REVAMPED add Meds page -> (work on seeing about a better UX/UI designs for simplicity and comfort in filling out.)
- [ ] Report page -> page with multiple reports
  - [ ] meds taken
  - [ ] meds missed 
  - [ ] meds left
  - [ ] warning meds low

## Kick off 

I think I am going to spend the majority from now till Nov 17th going through training courses,
working on a few html/css pages, some diving into a python computer science book, and the majority
working on features for my Medication App. This one is only getting 13 more days due to the nature
that I worked on some of it already during the past 2 weeks instead of a fresh new project getting
the full 30 days of time. Plus it is not set in stone yet 13 days, I could still add another week or
two to this project if it requires or justifies it. Being the first project and all, I want it to be a good Kick off. So here is to the Kick Off and to the next thirteen days of working on this project and 
learning anything to advance this project to its maximum quality.
