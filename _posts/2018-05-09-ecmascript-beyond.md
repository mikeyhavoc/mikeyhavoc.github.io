# Ecmascript 6

I have been working on learning some new stuff in JavaScript. It has been an adventure to say the least. It is one of the fastest moving languages in the past 5 years. After being stagnant for more than a decade though it did need a revamp.

## Thoughts On Direction

It has been interesting seeing its movements. It has gone from a small language just to make items move and interact on the screen. Too a real language with the same powers as other languages under es6, es7 so it has the power you would program and wield it like other languages but then compile down to es5 for browsers.

But I will have to come back to this... I am focused on NEXT.JS as of now for a project.
