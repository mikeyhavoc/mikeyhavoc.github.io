# First Digital Ocean Drop

I was hesitant, the first 7 were failures. Yet this time was different, not just a droplet.  I knew I had a reason to build the droplet and I think that was a reason it worked! I tried working my build out of my tools site on godaddy and nothing I mean **nothing** went right. I was so fed up. I went straight to twitter and asked my coding support for tips. _Digital Ocean_ came right up. I knew it was time for me to learn to push through in the next 24 hours.

## Riding a Bike Working a Computer

I dropped in Ubuntu 16.04 and felt right at home since that is my operating system. Next step, **SSH** WOAH BUDDY, never done that before. time for a tutorial!! that was like _bro_ where have you been all your life! I am by far not a master, and I am not 100% down with it yet, but I got my site up in about 25 minutes. Plus felt comfortable inside **SFTP**.

## 24 hour process

**SFTP** was interesting in the beginning but it was not bad to jump into afterwards. I felt right at home using the command line. it was great. I was really excited for this new approach actually compared to cPanel.

That is all for now!

until next time. Mikey havoc.
