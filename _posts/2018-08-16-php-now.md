# Back to PHP

I have spent some time working in HTMl and CSS. But now I am back in PHP.
Working on backend development, trying to get a handle on procedural before moving on to MVC.

## Preperation for Things to Come

It has not been too bad. The flow of control is smooth, and learning small amounts of reuse 
of code is wonderful. I find it as a small intro to MVC and Object-Oriented way of programming 
more than anything. Reusing code, seperations of concerns, and so on to make things more modular. The fact I have to build all my own functions is good practice for modifying and 
figuring out any underlying problems in later solutions. Also, gives me time to think about how to build query strings right for preventing SQL Injections in my own code.

## Next Up

Next up is practicing building a working CRUD application in PHP and MySQL. I am very excited about this. It is going to be very interesting to get something from front to bottom going all the way. Also, to see how the Create, Read, Update, Delete process works. So once complete, I will be looking for ways I can build out another application off the base application I build with the project course to get a better understanding! 

Until Next time,
