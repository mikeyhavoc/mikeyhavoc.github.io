# Tool Web Site Progress


- [x] host site.
- [x] up load images
- [x] up load database
- [x] responsive design. 
- [x] connect database and pages
- [ ] connect form to mail form.
- [ ] be able to form data to directed email.

Plus any other Little extras I can come up with while learning I want to add, as updates to the whole package.

1. Possibly a disable function on the buttons leading to items that have been sold.
2. A sort button for pricing up.
3. A sort button for pricing down.
4. Brand sorting.
5. A search box in the navigation box.

All possible after the first release drop of 1.0.0.
