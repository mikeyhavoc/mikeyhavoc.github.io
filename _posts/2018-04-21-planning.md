# Starting 100DaysOfCode Over

When I started a 100 days of code I was just doing any kind of code, everyday.
I had no plan laid out ahead of me other than what language to do it in. Even then I jumped around, I rabbit holed, I diverted off track easily. 

## Planning Ahead

But this time, I have created a plan far ahead to run off of. Also, I am going to try and track my progress better this round. Unlike last time. So I can get an idea how I am doing. 

## Long Haul

This trip I am going through a few things, and planning on building a lot. Because nothing is learned most by using and building. So that is my biggest goal this round.
Each week I plan on building something, or working on a project for my portfolio.
