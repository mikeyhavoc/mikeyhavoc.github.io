# Do You

Do you ever wonder how you got here? Think of all the things that put you
in the space, the zone, the place you are now? Is it the effort, the work,
luck, mistakes, or meant to be that placed you where you are?

## Concepts

if something is taken from something, then it shrinks.
Thus, leaving shrinkage, quakes, and destruction....if this reminds you of soemthing popular
it should.

## Thoughts

The earth is shrinking + we are pumping oil at alarming rates = similar to 'rick and morty pluto episode'.

The canonical should explain itself.

## Paranoia

The industry, the nations, the leaders, will never admit this until the world is gone. **why**<br>

- step 1. build systematic money maker
- step 2. rake in as much money as possible
- step 3. protect till death.

## Butter Fly Effect

As we can see things are going off balance on the earth. Things are not balanced,
things are not where they belong they are _slightly not on tragectory_.... possibly?
because the earth is _smaller_? How much smaller does something need to be? Well, to
take for an example if you know 1 to 2 degrees over **several miles** can throw you off
from landing on the right country...even continent.
