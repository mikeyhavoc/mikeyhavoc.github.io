# A Day that Got Away

So I started out really well today. I got up early kicked off working on JavaScript with Wes Bos.
Then some planning on my next website. I arranged for a meeting for an SEO gig. Then got hit by some
side stuff unlocking an IPad that was locked up due to a forgotten password and such. Took a lot of the day
for such a small feat.

## Wes and Variables

I worked on a lesson learning some new stuff about Css variables which is new on the playground.
Plus manipluating that with JavaScript in a NodeList. You run that through a forEach loop.
Next since you are handling the variables, you are modding the css variables in javascript just
do not forget to put the data suffix!
