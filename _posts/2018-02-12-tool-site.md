# Building a Tool Site

For my first project I got a Responsive, PHP, Mysql project. It has been a fun project,
 the breakdown is a flier of tools for sale, with their descriptions, brands, images, and etc.

## Thought Process

For this project since there was about 300 items and I would be updating the 'sale' to 'sold' on every single item.
I chose to use a database specifically to handle this without too much thought.
Also, the vast amount of data I would be dealing with that would be changing per item and remembering the DRY Principal.
I would reduce the amount of code if I would use a database by far in this route.

## Choices

With the varying choices around me, I went with PHP in the back-end, Mysql as the database, and Bootstrap frontend framework.
