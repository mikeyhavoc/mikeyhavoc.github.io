# The Ugly between You and I

Forms are annoying to say the least. They are the thing that come between the user and the developer. We interact with them often sometimes were okay with it and sometimes it is brutal. The more thought put into making a form, the more ease, the less difficulty of gathering data the more conversions and the happier the customer.

## Do Not Make Me Think

If you had to take 20 steps when it could take 5 would you be frustrated? Probably so. That is the way with forms. We have to look at forms from the angle as a checkout line. It is the last view of us they are going to get of us before heading out the door. So we need to make it simple, elegant, quick, and memorable.

## What Lays Ahead

### Design Problem

Today for the site I am making to sell my father's tools on, I am making a form... of course. With that said, I am trying to put as much design and though as extracting data out. Just pulling the data out is not the goal of my creations. Also, the form will appear possibly mobile, tablets, and desktop devices so responsive design is an important factor.

### Thoughts 

Before laying out the design I sketched up some ideas, looked at some forms, and thought about the problem. Which I am still contemplating.

- I have multiple items on a catalog page of items
- then I have a contact page to contact about an item. 
  - Next I need to either look up the item on the form page.
  - Or capture the data and send it to the contact page.
- Let them fill the rest of the form out.
- Finally send the form to me.

I might have to investigate this further later down the road. 
in a further drop.
