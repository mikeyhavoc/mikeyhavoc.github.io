# Lights out

As the door opened a blinding light struck me. Walking in a white room. It looked like it could go on forever. 
Completely empty and looking like something out of a horror film.

> "What the fuck do you want from me!" - I screamed. "Where the hell am I!" 

Unsure of anything and not knowing how to escape I started looking for something. I found a lone pen. Drawing on the walls, I drew pictures. I draw anything I could think. 

After what sounded like an eternity, I started to hear an alarm.

> Game Over! Game Over! Game Over!

Then I just saw fuzziness "what is going on?!" - I muttered completely lost.

Just then my eyes got uncovered, and Sean mutters 'Poor way to spend your time in the anything-verse.'

> What?! - I cough out as my head tries to recollect what happened.

> Hey your the the one who wasted it in a dream land that was fucked up and totally twisted.. you.you need therapy.,you were a fucking dude in your dream Michelle. It was a pathetic take on something sad as that stupid movie... you know the lame guy, and a giant sinking ship.. he should of pushed the girl off the board and saved himself but instead......... he drowns?! go over there as sean points to another machine, they have a therapy bot. Or.. you could watch what it is like to really play anything-verse!! hey-yo!
