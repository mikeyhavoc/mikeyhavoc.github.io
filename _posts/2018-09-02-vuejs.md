# Welcome to Vue.js Me

Here I come to Vue.js, I am off and trotting into unknown water,
to see another side of the waterfall. I feel I have come to a stand still in learning.
And to get over that hump, I need to break out and work on some things that are out of 
my comfort zone. 

## Planning

I am going to go through the teamtreehouse course on 
vue.js, and learn some stuff on vue. try some tricks. While
heading through some object oriented programming in PHP.
I want to be able to build some things using a framework in the end.
To seperate concerns. Less procedural and more object oriented 
design. 

I want to end up somewhere, I have been working hard on a lot of things but getting nowhere.
and it is frustrating. I am looking for the next step. So, I am gonna 
try to focus on one thing and aim straight and keep working on that
one thing through and through until it hits hard. Not walk away
after a little while, but to work on the same type of programming 
solving problems in the same language understanding it's ins and outs.

## Projected Goals

I want to after a while start working on some projects after developing
in said languages for a bit. and put together a portfolio, and 
start looking for some jobs or try for something in st. pete.
I am not sure yet, but something that is of value to society.
