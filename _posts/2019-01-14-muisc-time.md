# A Loop of Music and Time

If you loop a piece of music say about 5 seconds or 10 seconds of sound.
Now lets play with this and let some creativity flow and see what we can imagine this as….So got your creative juices flowing? Let us start playing
with ideas what this could model.
Let us go a science fiction route. Alright, we are beginning something from the beginning of its start. What else in science has a beginning and is mysterious we do not know where it began it just starts from nowhere.. Well the big bang.
So what if we modeled our sound as a universe through the big bang?
There are suppose to be multiple universes, that can be parallel to each other…right. Okay so let us pretend Universe 'a-1' is in the key of C.
It runs through the 5–10 seconds and as it plays the sound expands from nothing to the distance of 10 seconds of length… so guess what? We just traveled through time. Now we loop it… and we can travel through how that time began again and again and again.
Next we can move to the parallel universe of 'a-2' which is the key of C#.
So everything has shifted now…
