# Vanilla JS

So here I am working on some Array cardio in JavaScript 30, from Wes Bos.
Where everything is Vanilla Javascript without libraries.
It is a good practice workout to think in plain JavaScript,
 where were heading now a days. 

 ## Array Cardio Workout

 This lesson is on Arrays, and its methods. .filter, .map, .sort, .reduce, .list, and .reduce.
 For the items I have not used yet this is something I have been finding very interesting. 
 Also, I will be diving into not just once, but many times. To not just learn but to 
 master it and lock it into my head. Like the old adage, it takes a million times of doing
 to understand something.
