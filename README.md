# The Bartenders Fight Club

>Nothing more than stories, rants, tales, trailing tangents, and thoughts.

## What is this all about

This is the space for my mind. You can read. you can engage. your welcome to do whatever you like. Just do not get wrapped up too much.
When the stories are over, it is over. Or whatever comes about.

## interested in discussions? 

Hit me up in the discus, email me, or send me something in github.
Whether you are 

- learning web dev.
- want to collaborate on an idea.
- etc

I am an open minded person, and thats why I am on github it makes collaboration super simple and amazingly easy!
