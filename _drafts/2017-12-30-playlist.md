# Reasons

These are the songs, that got me through 2017, they helped me choose my tattoos, they are what make me who I am, and a lot of them are going to guide me through.
Take a listen and feel the lyrics, the guitars, the drums, the piano(on some), and more. Enjoy a little bit of what gets me through this Wild Life. - [note some adult content lol]

### Eulogy - Frank Turner

A short yet classic Frank Turner song speaks for itself honestly. As 'I will raise a glass and sing' ..... 'At least I fucking tried.'
The frustration, the anguish, perfection, I want, you want. Let it go. Because in reality; We cannot be what we cannot be, but hey we can give it our all and that is the only thing anything should ask from us.

### People Live Here - Rise against

This is a somber song at first, you think ::woah:: 'How could someone say that'.
But that is not what this song is even about. It is one of mine, due to people who believe this yet, when you hear the beauty of this song you will understand.

### Forget Me Not - Brian Fallon

Lighthearted yet not. A song about forgetting someone waiting for heaven, sitting in a form of limbo. Well that is the gist. but it is much more than that. The lyrics, the music, the beat. It is an experience.

### Rescued - Jacks Mannequin

This was one of the tipping points in my life. This song was there. I am a stubborn person. I am one of those people who never want to be rescued honestly.
'I do not want you to rescue me, I want you to stand by me while I rescue myself.' is more my style. So this song captures my emotions, from the past. As I felt walls caving in on me. As people tried to always save me from things, they did not need too. If I wanted saving I would of asked. But not from just anything. Just like as you grow, you can not be saved until you are ready to be saved. I find, your biggest savior is yourself. There is no harm in help, but if you do not choose your help, use your resources, and make that decision..nothing can save you from anything. 

### The Resolution - Jacks Mannequin

> "I'm Alive and I don't need a witness, to know that I survived, I am not looking for forgiveness". - The resolution
One of the strongest choruses so far. As I count 3 of my 9 lives up. This song takes a piece of me. and says you cannot give up

### Release Me - Jacks Mannequin 

> "I've been running such a long time. I've been hiding from the truth I've been battered, been broken, been buried Now i'm death proof, death proof.
All the time I feel, I have wasted. The time I have run around doing others lives.
I have fought, hid what I am, and yet other then with friends or in my safe space have not felt who I was. I feel is coming to an end and I finally trying to change that for the best.

### Recovery - Frank Turner

This song, from frank turner. Being an artist you can imagine I love the artwork. But not just that sometimes, we have sometimes have something that throws us a curve ball and we need some recovery from. This is that song for me.

### Photosynthesis - Frank Turner

This one speaks for itself. as the chorus kicks in, yep says everything. I will never shut up and I will never grow up.

### Funny you should ask - Front bottoms

As the chorus kicks in and you hear it sing..'But I'm older now and know that I should'
it just feels like part of life, part of growing up maybe, but it is true. As we age it is a reflection I believe we start to see whether we like it or not we should care. It is part of the game.

### Maps - Front Bottoms

This song reminds me.. sometimes we just gotta go for it. there is no time like now, there is no good, there is no bad, there is no time like today. Tomorrow is a myth and is what we tell ourselves to feel better, if we truly want something we do it then or we create the plan and action. But action starts that day, you throw off till tomorrow and it can roll like that forever till your out of tomorrows to give.

### Long Drives - Brian Fallon

This is one of those soothing songs, that you can just listen too. Has many meanings to many people and everyone's is different.

### run and stumble - Anthony Raneri

This is just an amazing song, from Anthony Raneri. I have heard this song a few times live and it is just amazing, let alone on record. It has the vibe of nostalgia yet pushes you for a brighter future all tat the same time. It just feels good to play.

### This is Letting go - Rise Against 

Listening to this song, you feel the beat. You think of your life. Were you a treasure seeker? What was I? What path am I following, and what path am I following? Those with me are they on the same path as I am? As I let go of that path to follow my dreams.

### Artchitects - Rise against

This song has so many memorable lines it is unbelievable. I must say this is one of my top songs of all time for a reason. but the lyrics:
> Don't you remember when you were young, and you wanted to set the world on fire? Somewhere deep down I know you do. And don't you remember when we were young, and we wanted to set the world on fire 'Cause I still am, and I still do.
get me over time. I feel the rush of being there, in the crowd hearing everyone singing along as we clapped with the drums. banging to the beat. bum bum, bum bum.

### Dead Man's Dollar - Andrew Mcmahon 

Dead Man's Dollar has a special place in my heart. I have been listening to Andrew McMahon since he was in Somthing Corporate. But This song is one of his finest pieces he has written through out his entire career. No matter where you are in your career at one point or another you or someone in your heart has been at a point where they have felt this way it seems. Especially in this day and age.
