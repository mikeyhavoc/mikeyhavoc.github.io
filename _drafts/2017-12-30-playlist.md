## Cheers

This is the play list that has spoken to me over the year(s).
Some harder rock, some piano rock, and some acoustic. While I looked for the appropriate of the song. I might have added notes why I chose the songs I did at the bottom.

# Reasons

These are the songs, that got me through 2017, they helped me choose my tattoos, they are what make me who I am, and a lot of them are going to guide me through.
Take a listen and feel the lyrics, the guitars, the drums, the piano(on some), and more. Enjoy a little bit of what gets me through this Wild Life. - [note some adult content lol]

### Eulogy - Frank Turner

A short yet classic Frank Turner song speaks for itself honestly. As 'I will raise a glass and sing' ..... 'At least I fucking tried.'
The frustration, the anguish, perfection, I want, you want. Let it go. Because in reality; We cannot be what we cannot be, but hey we can give it our all and that is the only thing anything should ask from us.

### People Live Here - Rise against

This is a somber song at first, you think ::woah:: 'How could someone say that'.
But that is not what this song is even about. It is one of mine, due to people who believe this yet, when you hear the beauty of this song you will understand.

### Forget Me Not - Brian Fallon

Lighthearted yet not. A song about forgetting someone waiting for heaven, sitting in a form of limbo. Well that is the gist. but it is much more than that. The lyrics, the music, the beat. It is an experience.

### Rescued - Jacks Mannequin

This was one of the tipping points in my life. This song was there. I am a stubborn person. I am one of those people who never want to be rescued honestly.
'I do not want you to rescue me, I want you to stand by me while I rescue myself.' is more my style. So this song captures my emotions, from the past. As I felt walls caving in on me. As people tried to always save me from things, they did not need too. If I wanted saving I would of asked. But not from just anything. Just like as you grow, you can not be saved until you are ready to be saved. I find, your biggest savior is yourself. There is no harm in help, but if you do not choose your help, use your resources, and make that decision..nothing can save you from anything. 

### The Reslotuion - Jacks Mannequin

> "I'm Alive and I don't need a witness, to know that I survived, I am not looking for forgiveness". - The resolution
One of the strongest choruses so far. As I count 3 of my 9 lives up. This song takes a piece of me. and says you cannot give up

### Release Me - Jacks Mannequin 

> "I've been running such a long time. I've been hiding from the truth I've been battered, been broken, been buried Now i'm death proof, death proof.
All the time I feel, I have wasted. The time I have run around doing others lives.
I have fought, hid what I am, and yet other then with friends or in my safe space have not felt who I was. I feel is coming to an end and I finally trying to change that for the best.
