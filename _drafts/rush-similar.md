# Divine Touchdowns

> Every small breath... is nothing but a miracle from an interior me casting a breath.

As my heart pounds harder I wake up in a sweat! Screaming, I almost jump out of my bed!
> What is going on in there? - yells the nurse
> We heard voices! who is here?! What is the commotion?! - the other children wanted to know
Unamused I shrugged it off, I am fine. I told them... just a nightmare; Please do not worry, I said. My lord I thought to myself, it was so real. I truly felt in the realm this time. I...I...chose. I decided to become a _similarity_..::gasp:: _no_, this can not be **reality**. That was in _my dreams_ though or was it? I had more questions now then answers. Fuck, oh..sorry where are my manners. I did not even introduce myself.

## introductions

My name is Justin, I am around 15 they estimate from all the tests they have done. I live in a medical facility for the... we will say special. I was left here when I was an infant, by someone no one knows to be raised and been having eerie dreams ever since. My doctors say it has something to do with my abandonment issues. I have it to do with my future, my past, and who I am.

The only thing that came with me was a bracelet, a special usb drive, and a fund to support me through out.. spending your entire life in a special hospital is not cheap, and dealing with psychiactric doctors is not either. Asking you about your dreams, your feelings, and what you think they mean. Then they contemplate and read out what you spoke on them and try to help you interpret them too.
Oh, thats right the dream.. where you came in...

## Interpretations Vs Accountability

### Highways & Truckstops

So, you do not say? You were involved in the same realm, before coming to me? Well then it must not be a coincidence, I do not believe in coincidences. _Please do not_ say you are here because you took the blood of a similarity? **You are**, are you? No wonder, I had another nightmare. shhhhh, is anyone around? No? good. Because there is a lot to go over then. This is only one of your many destinations to the _end of the line_ now.

### Attention::Attention

Well, I now know you met _Gor-gol_. He is not as nice nor as evil as he seems. I would never trust him though. He will appear many times on your journey, watch out for his 'Trades'. Because nothing is free, everything comes at a cost journeyman. Next, never forget a 'carry over today is worth much tomorrow'. This might not make sense now but it will in due time. Also, do not trust anyone from the Crym-nombylia. They seem quite honest, friendly, and out to help..but well you will understand if you choose otherwise.
