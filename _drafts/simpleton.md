# The Legends

> Choosing pieces, stars on the screen, lego pieces never going to be seen. We run on ties, platforms, and legendary icons from our day. These are the memories we form and sing about in a new age.

## Particles and Fairy Dust

What are you made of? This might come up someday, lots of answers are possible. Energy, protons, atoms, and the occassional fairy dust with mini me's powering larger me's running  larger me's. What you do not know of the self powering mini folk called 'mini similarities'?

## Mini Similarities

### Join The Realm

On the outside you have no idea someone is a mini similarity, they are just like you and me. This is further from the truth though, they are abstracts of nature I promise! These creatures look like you, they speak like you, and they bleed like you. But they are nothing like you. Mini similarities, are the most complex creatures in the chi-plex. Yet you have seen one, be amazed! You, yes mere human beings might be cross contaminated with a mini simlarity. You lucky spec of earth composte. Hey, I never said it truly was a bad thing....did I?

You now belong! Welcome, to being worth something more than just a meatbag. Or you know, another artifact for another alien race to dig up when your dead for an archalogical dig site.
