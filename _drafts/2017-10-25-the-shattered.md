# Signals and Flashbacks

I hear ringing in my ears...
something very familiar...yet something not quite right...

>Looking into the vast empty space, I could not help but feel vastly alone. I knew nothing of where I was.

## Scam and Paradise

>As I zoned back in, I was in a place where everyone was singing. They were so happy, positive, and believed in only one way.

Speaker : 
`This is the true way.. you are on the path now. do not be mislead by wolves in sheeps clothing. Only those among us are safe.`
