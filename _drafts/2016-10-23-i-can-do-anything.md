## The Theme Song

In a dusty, old town sat an elderly man tired from the battle he contended with. Looking at his watch, he knew the countdown was coming on now. Living the life of a hermit meant nothing to this gent. It suited him well, being alone on the opposite side of everything. A building built as if someone was preparing for a nuclear bomb to go off next door. There were many stories roaming the town about the building due to this and more. Graffiti covered sections with words "crazy", "Looney bin", "insane asylum", and so much more. Sometimes The man would spray paint artwork over it other times just leave it. To many in town this house was called the shelter....the asylum...but nothing nice.
