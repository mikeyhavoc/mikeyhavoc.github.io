# Dear Friend

It has been a long time and I suck at writing...let alone writing letters, lol. Although, this year has taken a toll on me for better, worse, and in between. I have seen more than my share of failures, successes, plus the occasional panic attack and thinking I was going to die. Yet only at a young age I find myself thinking as if I was a cat with 7 lives left.

## Live Long an Prosper

They say we only see life for what it is worth after it is flashing between our eyes. I think, I have seen this several times. I count the blessings I have, I count the friendships, and everything that is positive. Although, I take medications that keep me sedated so I don't feel all the stimulation that surrounds me. I feel too much anyways, I could imagine feeling more sometimes, then I do and all I can do is sit there because it is overwhelming. A blanket of emotions, rushing the mind...so strong that it just a waterfall of feelings over me. I know this is not the way it should be but this is the way it is for me and this suits me. I have come to terms with it. I have seen the other side of the coin, and it is not a pretty picture. Staying up for days, paranoid, on edge, uneasy, and on bouncing off the walls.

### Cheers To Those 

I must say though, to those who have found serenity. In the form they have found it, bless them. I for one will never know this. For every small step, is just a step. Peace to some is something special, or finding there way is something amazing. I know many, who find their so called calling. Something special, something they were meant for. Something they are amazing at, or something they are practically built for. _Cheers to those_ I must say. For this is not a story like that for me.

### Finding Happiness
