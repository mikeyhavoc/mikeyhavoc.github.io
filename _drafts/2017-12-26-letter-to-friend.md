# Dear Friend

It has been a long time and I suck at writing...let alone writing letters, lol. Although, this year has taken a toll on me for better, worse, and in between. I have seen more than my share of failures, successes, plus the occasional panic attack and thinking I was going to die. Yet only at a young age I find myself thinking as if I was a cat with 7 lives left.

## Live Long an Prosper

They say we only see life for what it is worth after it is flashing between our eyes. I think, I have seen this several times. I count the blessings I have, I count the friendships, and everything that is positive. Although, I take medications that keep me sedated so I don't feel all the stimulation that surrounds me. I feel too much anyways, I could imagine feeling more sometimes, then I do and all I can do is sit there because it is overwhelming. A blanket of emotions, rushing the mind...so strong that it just a waterfall of feelings over me. I know this is not the way it should be but this is the way it is for me and this suits me. I have come to terms with it. I have seen the other side of the coin, and it is not a pretty picture. Staying up for days, paranoid, on edge, uneasy, and on bouncing off the walls.

### Cheers To Those

I must say though, to those who have found serenity. In the form they have found it, bless them. I for one will never know this. For every small step, is just a step. Peace to some is something special, or finding there way is something amazing. I know many, who find their so called calling. Something special, something they were meant for. Something they are amazing at, or something they are practically built for. _Cheers to those_ I must say. For this is not a story like that for me.

### Finding Happiness

**Everyone** sees happiness as something different. Some it is a family, some it is money and being well off, others it is a content life, some a happy job, and others a mix of these and others. We all have to go and like so many other things appeal to our souls in a search, what do we truly need to be happy. Without this the karma, balance, or what you believe in will be off. I am searching for mine as we speak. It is not easy, I have:

- written lists
- pros and cons lists
- gone on a fast quest
- gone on a dream quest
- mediation sessions

#### Gloom some To Overcome

_Note: if you feel suicidal or like you might harm yourself or someone else, please seek professional help and call 911. This is not medical advice, and is in no way a substituee for medical attention when needed_

1. we feel depressed
1. we do not want to do anything
1. fun things become boring or dull.
1. friends are last on the mind and isolation seems nicer.
1. just wanna sleep.
1. time change
1. missing a med dosage

  But the big thing is to get into a habit of doing this everyday, even when we do not feel like it. Sometimes we get gloomy from like right now seasonal Affective disorder, maybe the time change, depression from something weighing on us, missing a medication dosage, or other reasons. 

#### Getting Out of the Rut

To get out of the rut, I started walking and listening to positive Podcasts. The walk in the sun gave me vitamin D, while the podcasts were uplifting and positive. They consists of coding podcasts, or Tony Robbins podcasts. I read on multiple sheets in mental health buildings, on sites, and in tweets it is beneficial to start your day with something uplifting. Whether that is music, pilates, yoga, podcasts, or something else it helps to start the day fresh with something positive to keep the day positive. Now there are going to be **days we do not want too** but on the same nerve, once we do them we things usually feel a little better.

### Senses Tingling

So there I was meditating and my senses kicked up, I brightened up with what was surrounding me. I could sense something was wrong, and I started focusing on all the past clues, things out of the ordinary. I flashed back on all that went on and I could sense things out of the ordinary. Things just did not line up, people were telling stories and others were clashing severely.


Tony is very inspirational and gives insightful thoughts on the things going in business, but I feel you can transform that to your regular lives.
Take advice for a business and especially in this day and age conform it to our daily lives. 
Especially since we are now more than ever selling our selves more than anything when acquiring positions in companies or self hire.
