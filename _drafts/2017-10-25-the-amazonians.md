# Count Down

> ... We count down as we wait for the mighty selector moving through the sky.

The mighty has risen once again, there is nothing we can do but rise also, to the occasion. Day or night, it is not ours to choose, but if be chosen. There is no going back, the writings of old have writings of fates once the decision has been made and not carried out. 

## Failing To Show 

Long ago, in the history files provides data telling of failing to carry out task. Note due to how fast Amazonian technology advances, this is considered lost technology since it is from the pre era. 
The files come from a repository dating in 1993, all files before 2000 are of ancient times to the Amazonians. 
Digging through the file it says about ->
`Failing To Carry Out`<br>
`if !person:`<br>
`Gather people for task()`<br>
`else:`<br>
`for task() carryout[commands] by_magnitude[reward/doom]:`<br>
`if task succes:`<br>
`return reward and survive`<br>
`else:`<br>
`return fail and ( death * maginutude )`<br>
 

 
   

     
    
   



## The Mighty Controllers Who Control  

The Controllers, that control our fate come from a far land. Much further than our ever expanding galaxy. 
**Selectors** are born constantly, they are majestic, with grace and power. No matter how far back in the writings of old, Selectors have been in creation. We are at their very mercy yet at the same time
