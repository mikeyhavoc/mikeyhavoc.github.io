## The Theme Song

In a dusty, old town sat a young man tired from the battle he contended with. Looking at his watch, he knew the countdown was coming on now. Living the life of a hermit meant nothing to this gent. It suited him well, being alone on the opposite side of everything. A building built as if someone was preparing for a nuclear bomb to go off next door. There were many stories roaming the town about the building due to this and more. Graffiti covered sections with words "crazy", "Looney bin", "insane asylum", and so much more. Sometimes The man would spray paint artwork over it other times just leave it. To many in town this house was called unholy....the asylum...but nothing nice.

### Speak with Ears

As the young man looked at his watch he was good, so he headed into town. Meanwhile without his notice, some teenagers were on the far end of his property.
> What do you think do you think is in there jake? - asked Steve
> I'm not sure but I assume he has money to be so young and not have a job! - Jake retorted.
As the young man open the door, the two teens could hear him speak something they couldn't decipher. Then he pushed something on a wall, and touched the ground. Completely confused the boys were baffled now, at what the young man was doing.
> Is he completely crazy? - asked Steve
> Well, when we landed on shore they warned us about this guy. Don't you remember Steve? They said the guy on the other side of the island is a odd, eclectic. When we asked about interesting people on the island.
> Can't we just leave? We already robbed the other people worth it on the island.... I can't imagine this guy has anything worth of value Jake. - whispered Steve.
> **man**, _I want it all_! - snorted Jake
> But if we do not leave now, the next ferry off the island leaves in the morning!! - retorted Steve
> Well, I am sure we can find a place to hide in the woods tonight, or ask a person in town to stay the night. - Jake huffed back.

### The Empty Pact

Twenty four hours earlier, a medium size vessel that comes every other day to the island was approaching.
> You boys have some large cases, are you new to the island? - asked one of the deckhands.
> You might say were on a short vacation there. - replied Jake.
> Odd timing for a vacation, then being near a blood moon. Never heard of people vacationing on that island that I reckon, let alone visiting this time of the solar cycle. - said another sailor.
Kind of confused looking, and nervous now.
> Oh you do not know, now I see, so your up too no good. Maybe you just belong there during a blood moon then. - chuckled the old sailor as he walked away.
> Jake, I don't like the sound of that. Even that old sailor already knows what were up too already! Yet we haven't landed yet? That doesn't sound good mate. Also, this blood moon and no one else on the boat, no one else visiting, nor going over? All we saw were people leaving the island, man what does that tell you? - Said a young boy named Steve very fervently.
