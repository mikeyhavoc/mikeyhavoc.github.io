              <p>Good Question...What is Bartenders Fight Club?.<br>
                 Covering from Programming, Web Development, music,
                 vast spans of thoughts, ideas, dreams, and stories.
                 Why more than a lot of programming, web development,
                  and coding you ask? Well, I am human, I am multidimensional
                 and I want this blog to show their is more to me.. than just 
                 coding. Life goes on with or without coding, PRoblem solving 
                 though never ends, nor does life in general so that is rolled
                 in this blog here and there. Possible talks of sci-fi 
                 popular culture, yes it might appear. If it casts doubt on life,
                 existence, or the universe? it might appear.
                 Everything else... is fair play too. I over think, I dream, I wonder.</p>

            <p>
                I prefer this sphere, over all others for a writing space. No other is as free, or as open as the github landscape.
                Anything goes, and freedom of creation feels more real in this landscape than any other. So I prefer to call this my home for my Home.

               The Blogs, stories, tales, and thoughts within are makings of the mind. No one was hurt. Some are remakes, some are remixes, some are puns, and any story related material should not be taken seriously. The mind is only as dangerous as you let it be. With that said, if you enjoy what comes about.. follow if you enjoy.
